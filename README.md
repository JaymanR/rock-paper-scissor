# rock-paper-scissor

This is a Rock Paper Scissor game with a UI that is played against a bot. 

To start, select one of the three button next to their images: Rock, Paper, Scissor.

Once the player clicks on a button it will show the 'versus-text' showing the player selection v.s. computer selection and then output the result.

First to 5 points wins the game, the points or the score is displayed above the player column and the Bot column.

Once 5 points have been reached by the player or the bot, the selection buttons will no longer function and the plyer will have to click the "Play Again" button to start a new game to play again.
